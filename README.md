# CQRS Pattern 

In this project, I implemented CQRS Pattern with C#. The solution follows the Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles and use CQRS to perform Read and Update operations. 

* [UI](./Factory)
* [Application)](./DependencyInjection)
* [Domain](./DependencyInversion)
* [Infrastructure](./UnityContainer)
